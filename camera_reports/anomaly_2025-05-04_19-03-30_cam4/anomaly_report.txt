The detected anomaly involves an arson event where two individuals are initially observed standing near a counter or bar. Later, they are seen wearing jackets and captured by a black-and-white security camera near a vehicle at night, suggesting potential preparation or involvement in setting a fire. The interactions and positioning near the vehicle indicate suspicious behavior consistent with arson activity.
